Grammar Scoring Submission

This submission contains predicted grammar scores for the SHL Hiring Assessment competition. Our model analyzes linguistic features and predicts scores using a regression-based approach.

Overview:
Performance: The model achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.5375, showing a moderate relationship between actual and predicted scores.

Approach: We used a regression model to make predictions, visualized through a scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted scores.

While the results are promising, thereâ€™s still room for improvement! Further enhancements like better feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, or experimenting with more advanced models could boost accuracy.
